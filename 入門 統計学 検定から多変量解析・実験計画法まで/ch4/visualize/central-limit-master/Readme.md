# Central Limit Theorem

## About
This is an attempt to visually explain the core concepts of the [Central Limit Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem). By providing a variety of interactive components, this page seeks to provide an intuitive understanding of one of the foundational theories behind inferential statistics. It draws inspiration from other visual explanations, such as this one on [decision trees](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) and these wonderful projects from [setosa.io](http://setosa.io/#/).

Importantly, this **is not** a robust explanation of the theory, and it was not written by a formally trained statistician. If you have any feedback (about the explanation, implementation, or design), feel free to reach out on on [twitter](http://twitter.com/mf_viz).
