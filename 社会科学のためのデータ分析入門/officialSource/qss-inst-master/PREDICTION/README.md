# Exercises for Chapter 4: Prediction
## Exercises in QSS
1. [Prediction Based on Betting Markets](betting-markets)
   * *Summary*: In this exercise, students will predict the 2008 and 2012 US presidential election outcomes using betting markets. To do this, students will gain additional practice with loops and regressions.

   * *Sections of QSS*: 4.1, 4.2
2. [Election and Conditional Cash Transfer Program in Mexico](conditional-cash-transfers)
   * *Summary*: This exercise analyses the data from a study that seeks to estimate the electoral impact of 'Progresa,' a cash-based program in Mexico. Students will get additional practice calculating treatment effects in randomized experiments and using linear regression.

3. [Government Transfer and Poverty Reduction in Brazil](gov-transfer-brazil) (Thanks to Brandon de la Cuesta)
   * *Summary*: This study estimates the effects of increased government spending on educational attainment, literacy, and poverty rates. Students will apply regression discontinuity design and gain additional practice with loops.

## Additional exercises
1. [The Fox News Effect](fox-news-effect) (Thanks to Tolya Levshin and [Ted Enamorado](https://github.com/tedenamorado))
   * *Summary*: This exercise analyzes a study that attempts to quantify the effect of the national news media on national voting behavior. Students will practice skills with qqplots, k-means clustering algorithms, and difference-in-differences estimates.

3. [Predicting Elections Using Betting Markets and Linear Models](betting-markets-with-lm) (Thanks to [Will Lowe](https://github.com/conjugateprior))
   * *Summary*: This exercise serves as additional practice for the 'betting markets' precept above. This exercise provides students with additional practice with regressions and loops.

4. [Predicting the 2016 US Presidential Election](election-clinton-trump) (Thanks to [Mariana Campos Horta](https://github.com/marianaCH))
   * *Summary*: This exercise uses early data to predict the electoral college results of the 2016 US presidential election. Students will gain additional practice with loops, if statements, and plots.
   * *Sections of QSS*: 4.1, 4.2
5. [Immigration Attitudes: The Role of Economic and Cultural Threat](immigration-threat) (Thanks to [Alex Kustov](https://github.com/alexkustov))
   * *Summary*: This exercise aims to answer why the majority of voters in developed countries tend to be opposed to increased immigration. Students will have a number of opportunities to practice running regressions.

6. [Government Revenues and Corruption](gov-corruption) (Thanks to [Tyler Simko](https://github.com/tylersimko))
   * *Summary*: This exercise explores the 'political resource curse,' the theory that increases in government resources may lead to corruption. Students will use Regression Discontinuity (RD) to analyze these effects.

7. [Co-ethnic Candidates and Voter Turnout](race-and-voting)
   * *Summary*: This exercise looks Fraga's study that assess the theory that minority voters are more likely to vote in elections featuring co-ethnic candidates. Students get practice interpreting regressions with one or multiple predictors.
