Read 4.1, Swirl Chap 4 part 1

## Misc

 1. Return psets – review if needed
 2. Pset 3 - Emphasize the need to use labels, titles, color, text, shapes to make helpful and understandable plots and that this is part of answering the question correctly.
  
## Swirl Review – if necessary (5 min)

 1. cat() question poorly worded on our part, could go over quickly - don’t have to always use together, cat() doesn’t create output just prints, paste() creates usable string output, only prints if last command called function

 4. Why use loops?

    1. for loops, counter in (), arguments in {}
    2. create bin ahead of time to store output
