# Lesson Plan for *Conditional Cash Transfers*

## Misc
   1. Errors are ok – how we learn -- but can reduce dumb errors (typos) with tab complete.
   
## Problem Set 3 Handed back

 1. Emphasize looking at associations not causation (e.g. higher GDP associated with longer life expectancy)
 2. Q2 not clear, so didn’t take off, but easier to interpret if use cluster info from scaled vars but look at means of unscaled vars

 1. Regression with multiple predictors - can review via in-class problem
     1. review R-squared
     2. dummy variables
     3. heterogenous treatment effect

## In-class problem
 
Cash Transfer Program in Mexico Section 4.5.2

## Problem set 4 (last one!)
  
Ideology of US Supreme Court Justices

 1. Data: justices.RData
 2. Functions used: mean, median, SD, plot, loop, tapply, subset, plot within a loop
