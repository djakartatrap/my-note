## Lesson Plan

### 1. Main activity: Revisiting the 2016 Presidential Election  (60 minutes)

  * For Questions 1, 2, and 3 the QSS exapmle on the 2008 election will be extremely useful. This example goes through predicting the outcome, calculating the 95% confidence intervals and bias correction. 
  * After Questions 1 and 2, 3 shoud be straightforward. 
  * For Question 4, we are assuming that the predicted proportion of support is distributed normally and are using this assumption to calculate the probability that Trump wins each state with the CDF of the normal distribution. We then use these probabilities to determine the outcome for each state in 1000 simulations (like a weighted coinflip). In this sense we are doing a quasi-Bayesian analysis, allowing for uncertainty in our parameters of estimated support in each state. This will likely be a challenging concept for many students.
  
### 2. Wrap-up (10 minutes)
  * Discuss other potential hypotheses for why the election had such a surprising outcome and how we might test these hypotheses (i.e. turnout demographics and voter files etc)
  * Answer any remaining questions
