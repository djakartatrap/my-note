## Lesson Plan

### 1. Main activity: Moving to Opportunity experiment (60 minutes)

  * Introduce the MTO experiment, discuss its significance. 
  * After reviewing Q1 and before students attempt Q2, you may want to show them the compliance figure I posted on github. That figure will give students a better understanding of the implementation challenges of MTO. 
  * The activity is fairly easy and you may have time for Question 4, if students don't have too many questions. 
  
### 2. Wrap-up (10 minutes)
  * Answer any remaining questions
  * If you have time after answering questions about this week's material and preparing for the take-home exam, discuss the final project. Answer questions about finding data, processing data, formatting the markdown file, etc.
