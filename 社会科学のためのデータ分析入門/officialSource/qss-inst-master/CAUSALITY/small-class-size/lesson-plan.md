# Lesson Plan for *Small Class Size*

Big picture: Experimental research designs and causality, using functions to summarize data

## Due before class: 

* Chapter 2 swirl
* Reading Chapter 2

## 10-15 min swirl review

R concepts: 

 * character, logical, numeric, factor
 * Logical operators: `|`, `==`, `&` 
 * `length`, `mean`
 * `read.csv`, `dim`, `summary`, `table`
 * `ifelse`
 * `subset`
 * `tapply`

## Key Concepts: 

 * Measures of central tendency
 * Randomized controlled trials 
 * Internal vs. external validity
 * Causality, counterfactuals, potential outcomes

## 30 min in class exercise
 
Small-class size and primary education 

 * 5 minutes on recoding variables (STAR question 1)
 * 10 minutes on using `mean` to identify treatment effects (STAR question 2)
 * 10 minutes on using `quantile` to identify treatment effect heterogeneity (STAR question 3)   
 * 5 minutes on `tapply` for the rest of the problems 
#
# 30 min small group work

Make sure students understand `tapply` and `subset` for the rest of the STAR questions
