# Lesson Plan for *Leader Assassination*

## Beginning of class:

 - Arrange in groups
 - Normal to be stressed, but work efficiently!
 - Read the book: How many people read about the NJ/PA example before lecture?

## Review Problem Set 1 (20 min total)

Key concepts: Conceptual (5 min)

 * What was the main finding of the experiment?
 * How did the experiment establish a causal effect?
 * Randomization checks, 'balance'
 * Review the common structure of experiments
 * Review the common format of experimental data

## R functions (15 min)

What were the functions you used the most?

 * `mean`, `subset`, and `tapply`
 * sequential subsetting using `&`
 * Explain inputs for each

## Introduction to observational studies (10 min)

 * Observational studies; naturally assigned treatment
 * What is a treatment? What is an outcome?
 * NJ/PA example: why is this important? Why can't we run an experiment?
 * Researchers cannot conduct an intervention; Ethically, raising the minimum wage might hurt low-wage workers
 * Differences-in- differences; have students interpret plot.
 * confounders: cross-sectional and time-varying
 * parallel trends assumption; the Basque example

## Interactive Classroom Exercise (30 min)

What is the problem? confounding bias

What is a control variable?

External versus internal validity

Different types of arguments for and against causality

## Work in groups (30 min)
