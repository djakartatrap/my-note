# Lesson Plan for Coethnic Voting in Africa

## Before class

* Read Chapter 2 of *QSS*
* Completed swirl lessons for Chapter 2 (`CAUSALITY1` and `CAUSALITY2`)
* Read Chapter 2 (Sections 2.1--2.4) of *QSS*
* Completed swirl lessons for Chapter 2 (`MEASUREMENT1`) 

## Lesson Plan

### 1. Check in (5 minutes)

* Ask about experiences with R/Swirl and trying out code -- get a sense of what students are struggling most with and what seems conceptually harder.

* Remind students of the various resources and support available

### 2. Swirl review and questions (10 - 15 minutes)

### 3. Main activity: Spousal Coethnic Vote: Observational Afrobarometer data and Survey experiment  (55 - 60 minutes)

* Data required: `afb.csv` and `benin.csv`
* The activity should be done interactively or via group work. Walk around the room to check on progress and make yourself available for questions. Revert to the whole class to address frequently asked questions. Note there are two datasets so make sure the students are using the correct dataset for each section of the activity.

### 4. Wrap-up (5 minutes)

* Reflect on the main activity. What are the challenges? Any remaining questions?
* Have them submit their **Rmarkdown** file to Blackboard "Precept 2" folder
