## Exercises in QSS
1. [Efficacy of Small-class Size in Early Education](small-class-size) (Thanks to [Elisha Cohen](https://github.com/ecohen13))
   * *Summary*: Is there a causal effect of small class sizes on educational performance? This exercise provides an introduction to measuring treatment effects in randomized experiments.

   * *Sections of QSS*: 2.1-2.4, 2.6 
2. [Changing Minds on Gay Marriage](gay-marriage) (Thanks to [James Lo](https://github.com/jameslo989))
   * *Summary*: Can a simple conversation change someone's mind on social issues? Students will analyze data from a randomized canvassing experiment to get first-hand experience finding treatment effects, descriptive statistics, and more.

   * *Sections of QSS*: 2.1-2.4, 2.6
3. [Success of Leader Assassination as a Natural Experiment](leader-assassination)
   * *Summary*: This exercise considers a natural experiment in which the success or failure of assassination attempts is assumed to be essentially random. This provides students with an opportunity to analyze data from an observational study and practice difference-in-means effects, custom variables, and other basic R commands.

   * *Sections of QSS*: 2.2, 2.3, 2.5, 2.6

## Additional exercises
1. [Effect of Demographic Change on Exclusionary Attitudes](exclusionary-attitudes) (Thanks to [Elisha Cohen](https://github.com/ecohen13))
   * *Summary*: The study used in this exercise assessed the extent to which views can be affected by exposure to demographic change. Students will get more practice subsetting data in R, calculating descriptive statistics, and estimating treatment effects.

2. [Health Savings Experiment](health-savings) (Thanks to [Yo-Yo Chen](https://github.com/shuangyoyo))
   * *Summary*: What are the some of the key barriers to saving for poor people? Students will use data from a field experiment to estimate various treatment effects to work towards an answer, getting plenty of practice calculating descriptive statistics for several groups simultaneously along the way.

3. [Inequality of Success in Online Music Markets](music-markets) (Thanks to [Daniela Urbina](https://github.com/danielaurbina))
   * *Summary*: What causes a song to become popular? Is success based on inherent musical qualities, or are more complex *social* processes at work? Students will analyze data from a web-based randomized experiment to estimate the effects of certain social processes on song ratings.

4. [Indiscriminate Violence and Insurgency](indiscriminate-violence) (Thanks to Will Bullock and Jaquilyn Waddell Boie)
   * *Summary*: This study analyzes the relationship between indiscriminate violence and insurgent attacks. Students will get more practice analyzing data from observational studies and comparing differenct outcomes between various groups.
