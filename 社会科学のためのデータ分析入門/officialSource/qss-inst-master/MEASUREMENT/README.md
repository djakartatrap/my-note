# Exercises for Chapter 3: Measurement
## Exercises in QSS
1. [Changing Minds on Gay Marriage: Revisited](gay-marriage-revisited) (Thanks to [Katie McCabe](https://github.com/ktmccabe))
   * *Summary*: This exercise returns to gay marriage study analyzed in Chapter 2 and follows the work of scholars who noticed a few peculiar irregularities in the data. Students will practice skills on calculating and interpreting correlations, comparing distributions, and practice quantile-quantile plots.

2. [Political Efficacy in China and Mexico](political-efficacy)
   * *Summary*: This study analyzes and compares political efficacy, which is an attempt to measure citizen's faith in their government, between countries. Working with this data provides several opportunities to practice summarizing bivariate relationships and master various types of plotting in R.

2. [Leader Assassination (Graphics)](leader-assassination-graphs)
   * *Summary*: Do individual political leaders actually make a difference? This study uses assassination attempts as a mean to study the effects of political leaders via ideology change. Students will get more practice working with distributions, using the difference-in-differences method, and working with new types of plots.
