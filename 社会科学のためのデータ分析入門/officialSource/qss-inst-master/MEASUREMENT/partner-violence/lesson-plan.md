## Lesson Plan

1. Check in (5 minutes)

  * Ask about experiences with R/Swirl and trying out code -- get a sense of what students are struggling most with and what seems conceptually harder.
  * Remind students of the various resources and support available

2. Swirl review and questions (10 - 15 minutes): Chapter 3 (MEASUREMENT1)

3. Main activity: "Access to Information and Attitudes towards Intimate Partner Violence" (55 - 60 minutes)

  * Data required: `dhs_ipv.csv`. Important to note that different countries participated in different waves of the survey. The activity should be done interactively or via group work. Walk around the room to check on progress and make yourself available for questions. Revert to the whole class to address frequently asked questions. 

4. Wrap-up (5 minutes)

  * Reflect on the main activity. What are the challenges? Any remaining questions?
  * Have them submit their Rmarkdown file to the corresponding Precept section folder under Course Materials, Week 3.
