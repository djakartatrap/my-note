# Lesson Plan for Diverse Mechanisms of Migration

## Before class

* Read Chapter 3 of *QSS* (Sections 3.5-3.7)
* Completed swirl lessons for Chapter 3 (`MEASUREMENT2`) 
* Download precept materials

## Lesson Plan

1. Check in (5 minutes)

   * Ask about experiences with R/Swirl and trying out code -- get a sense of what students are struggling most with and what seems conceptually harder.

   * Remind students of the various resources and support available.


2. Swirl review and questions (10 - 15 minutes)

   * Swirl Chapter 3 (MEASUREMENT2)

   * Review syntax of relevant R code for precept exercise (`kmeans()`).


3. Main activity: Diverse Mechanisms of Migration (55 - 60 minutes)

   * Data required: `migration.csv`

   * The activity should be done interactively or via group work. Walk around the room to check on progress and make yourself available for questions. Revert to the whole class to address frequently asked questions.


4. Wrap-up (5 minutes)

   * Reflect on the main activity. What are the challenges? Any remaining questions?
   * Have them submit their **Rmarkdown** file
